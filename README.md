# Driver-gene-identificantion  
Integrative analysis and identification of cancer driver genes using publicly available mutation data
Driver mutations are somatic mutations that help in cancer progression while passenger mutations have no effect on the fitness of a cancer cell. Distinguising drivers from passengers is challenging because drivers occur less frequently than passengers and their functional impact is not intuitively obvious. Several computational approaches have been developed so far to generate a list of high confidence cancer driver genes. In this project, three of the most popular driver prediction tools were used to identify driver genes across six cancer types and their accuracy in terms of overlap with the [Cancer Gene Census](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census) were noted. Mutational load comparison between the downloaded mutation data and TCGA cohorts was performed and a list of common oncogenic pathways affected for each cancer type were validated with the existing literature. Finally, a list of high confidence drivers predicted by all three tools were generated. A short analysis showed that different cancer types share altered genetic components that can be used as prime therapeutic targets.
